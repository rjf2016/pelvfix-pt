    question: 'What does an internal pelvic exam entail?',
    answer: [
      "An internal pelvic floor exam allows us to accurately assess the muscles, nerves, and connective tissues of the pelvic area by accessing the area via the vaginal canal or rectum. This type of exam helps us understand any underlying issues affecting your pelvic health. While entirely optional, it's highly recommended for a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",

      'Before any internal or external exam, weâ€™ll explain the process with a model, and youâ€™ll have the chance to ask questions and provide consent. The exam involves using clean, gloved hands to gently evaluate your pelvic floor muscles, and you can stop at any time. No stirrups or speculums are used, and your comfort and consent are always our top priority.',
